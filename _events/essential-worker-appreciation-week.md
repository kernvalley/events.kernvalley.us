**What**: Essential Worker Appreciation Week.

**When**: Mon. April 13 - 17.

**Where**: All around the Kern River Valley.

**Why:** The same people who are keeping the world going right now are also the
most exposed to the virus and, instead of being thanked for what they do, too often
they are yelled at for store policies that help prevent hoarding or have Lysol
sprayed in their faces.

**How:** On the corresponding day of the week, bring in a thank you card, flyer,
poster, or whatever you come up to hang on a wall or in a window to let the employees
know that they are appreciated. And, while we're at it, let's all try to be decent
human beings to each other.

Each day of the week, let's make extra effort to appreciate the work and sacrifices
of our friends, family, and neighbors. Go out of your way to show them gratitude
and to not make their jobs any more difficult or stressful than they need to be.
Just that we're trying to avoid putting them in any more risk of being infected.
