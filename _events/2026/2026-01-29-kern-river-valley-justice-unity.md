This gathering is about recognizing the reality of the environment we live in and choosing to strengthen our community from the inside out. While we are not the direct victims of the violence that took Renee Good, Alex Pretti, and many others, we all live within the climate of fear and division that preceded these tragedies. This is a space to acknowledge that impact and decide how we want to grow as neighbors.

The purpose of this forum is proactive. Instead of letting isolation take hold, we are coming together to build positive connections and a stronger foundation of mutual support. It is an opportunity to talk openly about the environment surrounding us and to focus on the growth that happens when neighbors actually share their experiences and listen to one another.

By gathering, we are doing the work of strengthening our local ties. We are choosing to invest in the people who live here and to foster a community where truth and neighborly support are the standard. The evening will conclude with a quiet recognition of the injustices suffered by those lost, standing together to ensure their humanity is acknowledged and that our focus remains on a more unified future.
