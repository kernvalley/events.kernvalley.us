The Point in Time Count is a snapshot view of homelessness in Kern County. We depend on an accurate PIT Count to receive
adequate funding and ensure proper allocation of resources and energy to address homelessness. However, the Kern River Valley
is often lacking in volunteers participating in this annual event and, as a result, there is a lack of funding due to
under-reporting. Unlike more populated and urban areas, the KRV does not have a shelter to provide an easy place to conduct
the survey. It is also difficult for some of the volunteers to hike into the areas required.
