The Great Kern River Cleanup is the premier volunteer event focused on removing
trash and restoring the health of the Mighty Kern throughout Sequoia National Forest.
This cleanup is an annual event coordinated by the [Sierra Nevada Conservancy](http://www.sierranevada.ca.gov/)
and held in conjunction with the Great Sierra River Cleanup and [California Coastal Cleanup Day](http://www.coastal.ca.gov/publiced/ccd/ccd.html)
to encourage good stewardship from the Sierra to the sea.

The Cleanup kicks off Sierra Nevada Watershed Protection Week, established in 2015
to highlight the importance of the Sierra Nevada Region to the entire state. More
than 60% of California’s developed water supply originates in the Sierra Nevada
and millions of visitors travel to the Sierra to hike, camp, and sightsee. Whether
you think of Tahoe, Yosemite, Mammoth, or the Giant Sequoias — the Sierra connects us all.
