The Kern River Valley community is invited to an appreciation event honoring the hard work of veterans and volunteers. This dedicated group has been instrumental in post-fire cleanup and hazard removal, safeguarding our community from erosion, flooding, and future wildfire threats.

The event will take place on May 31 at 5:30 PM at the KRV Bridge Connection. Come enjoy live music from Way Too Country as we celebrate the efforts of Team Rubicon, a veteran-led humanitarian organization. Team Rubicon deployed 25 trained volunteers to Lake Isabella and surrounding communities from May 28 to June 4 to assist with post-fire cleanup following the Borel Fire. Their work focused on removing hazardous vegetation and debris, especially along waterways at risk of flooding or erosion.

This vital effort is a collaboration between Team Rubicon, the Kern Fire Safe Council, Kern River Conservancy, and KRV Bridge Connection, with funding from the Kern Community Foundation. All services were provided at no cost to residents, with priority given to veterans, seniors, and individuals with disabilities. This partnership reflects a shared commitment to long-term community resilience, public safety, and recovery from wildfires.
