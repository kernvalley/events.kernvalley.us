> International Volunteer Day, commonly known as IVD, is celebrated on 5 December every year. It started as an
international observance mandated by the United Nations General Assembly in 1985. It is a day where volunteers
are acknowledged and the spirit of volunteerism is promoted at the local, national and international levels.

- - -

Join us this year as we celebrate the invaluable contributions of volunteers across our community!

We are hosting a special event on Fri. Dec 5 at 5:30 PM at KRV Bridge Connection to show deep appreciation
for all community volunteers, with a dedicated segment for special recognition.

### Event Highlights & Recognition

This gathering will bring together nonprofit organizations, churches, and members of the community
to honor the dedication and impact of local volunteer efforts.

The event will feature special recognition for outstanding volunteers. Recognition will be provided
through donations collected from local businesses for:

- Volunteers nominated by participating organizations.
- One "Community Voted Volunteer" selected by the public.

### Support & Funding

This International Volunteer Day celebration is proudly hosted and funded through the Neighbor-to-Neighbor program,
a key initiative supported by California Volunteers.
