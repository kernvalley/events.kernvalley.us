Get ready for an impactful day at Bridge to Resources, an event proudly presented in partnership with
[Community Action Partnership of Kern (CAPK)](https://krvbridge.org/partners/capk). We're bringing together
over a dozen local nonprofits for a day focused on practical assistance and community engagement.

Bridge to Resources is designed to provide tangible support. Many participating nonprofits will be on-site,
ready to offer direct services to attendees.

In addition to valuable help, the day will feature games, music, and various activities within our vibrant
community garden and event space. It's a great opportunity to connect with essential resources and enjoy
time with your family and neighbors.

Join us at Bridge to Resources for a day of services, connection, and community fun.
