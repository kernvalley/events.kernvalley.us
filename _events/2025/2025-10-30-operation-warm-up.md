 We are raising funds as a community to provide blankets, sleeping bags, beanies, and other warm clothing for our neighbors in need. New items will be purchased and distributed at locations throughout the Kern River Valley beginning on Fri. October 30.

 Help us keep children, seniors, and families warm this winter by supporting our blanket and essentials drive.

Every donation helps provide blankets, gloves, and winter essentials to neighbors who need them most.

Check back soon for more information!
