## Volunteers Needed

September is **Hunger Action Month**, a nationwide effort to fight hunger and raise awareness about food insecurity.

## Help Us Feed Our Community

The KRV Bridge Connection Emergency Choice Pantry has faced a difficult month—repeatedly forced to close when shelves
went bare and families arrived to find no food available. This large upcoming delivery, along with a new commercial
freezer, is critical to ending those shutdowns and ensuring we never have to turn anyone away hungry and empty-handed.

We need community volunteers to help unload the food, move the freezer into place, and safely store the shipment so it’s
ready for families who rely on us.
