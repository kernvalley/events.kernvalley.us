Join us for Kick & Flip 360 as we celebrate the one-year anniversary of the George & Darlene Randall Skatepark in Lake Isabella! Last year's "Kick & Flip" grand opening not only launched this incredible community space but also kicked off the Neighbor-to-Neighbor Grant, signaling a commitment to investing in our rural community and "flipping the script" on the narrative of neglect.

This year, "360" invites us to look back at the amazing strides we've made and look forward to the continued positive change ahead. It's a day to recognize how far we've come and to embrace the future we're building together.

Get ready for a day packed with fun for all ages, including water slides, music, skate competitions with prizes, various games, and delicious food from local vendors. Come celebrate with us and be a part of this ongoing journey of community revitalization!
