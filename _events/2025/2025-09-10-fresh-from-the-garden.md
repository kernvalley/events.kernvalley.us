Join us for a celebration of our community garden's abundant harvest, a feast of freshness grown right here in our
neighborhood. We believe that good food starts with fresh ingredients, and this event is our way of sharing the
vibrant flavors and healthy benefits of our hard work.

Our garden has yielded a spectacular bounty of ripe grape tomatoes, tangy tomatillos, and fiery peppers. To show
you what's possible with this seasonal produce, we've teamed up with a local chef who will be preparing delicious,
fresh salsa using ingredients straight from our beds. This is a chance to taste the difference that truly fresh
vegetables can make.

We'll be giving away free bags of our surplus produce, including these delicious tomatoes, tomatillos, and more.
This is a perfect opportunity to bring home a taste of the garden and get inspired to make healthy, wholesome
meals for your family. We hope to see you there, connecting with neighbors and celebrating the simple pleasure
of fresh, homegrown food.
