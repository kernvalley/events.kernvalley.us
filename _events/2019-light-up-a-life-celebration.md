Each year Optimal Hospice Foundation hosts several local remembrance celebrations
throughout California during the   month of December and invites the community to
sponsor a light on a tree in memory of a loved one or to honor someone living.
All proceeds from light donations help provide hospice services in your local community.

The celebration includes a personal reflection by a hospice family member, the
reading of the memorial names by hospice nurses & volunteers, inspirational music,
and the lighting of our Tree of Life. The Tree of Life is adorned with ornaments
representing a light in memory of loved ones and friends. Candle lightings take
place at all outdoor events.

The Celebration is free to attend and open to everyone, not just those touched by
hospice care. For a minimum $10 donation an ornament with your loved ones name will
be placed on our Tree of Live and if received prior to the event date their name
will be read during the Celebration.

A donation form can be found and printed by opening the attachment on their
[website](http://www.optimalhospicefoundation.com/index.php/events/light-up-a-life).
