We're stronger together. On Monday May 11th at 1PM [{% include icon.html icon="link-external" %} Kernville Cowork](https://www.kernvillecowork.com/en),
in cooperation with the [{% include icon.html icon="link-external" %} Kernville](https://www.gotokernville.com/)
and [{% include icon.html icon="link-external" %} Kern River Valley](https://www.kernrivervalley.com/) Chambers of Commerce, will be hosting a
roundtable discussion with business owners and leaders in the Kern River Valley.
All Kern River Valley businesses are invited to attend, regardless of industry,
shutdown status, or membership status.

The main topic of discussion will be strategies and tools for reopening safely
and within compliance. We will have experts on the call that have worked with
businesses in the valley to help them achieve compliance, as well as implementing
new systems that will help them thrive even after the shutdown is entirely lifted.

Please share with other businesses in the Kern River Valley so they can join the
discussion, regardless of membership. There is no fee or membership requirement
for this event. Share this link when inviting others to join:
