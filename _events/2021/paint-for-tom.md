Join us Wednesday, December 8<sup>th</sup> at The Kernville Saloon for a fundraiser paint
class to help raise money for Tom Beaton! Tom has been battling cancer. 100% of
the proceeds will be directly donating to Tom to help with medical expenses.

> A lot of people know Tom Beaton either from growing up with him, from his many
> years as a AAA tow truck driver from Kernville Garage or more recently from
> working security at the Kernville Saloon and several local events. What most
> people don’t know is He was recently diagnosed with bladder cancer. It’s not
> easy for a guy like him to ask for help so I will. I am hoping to raise some
> funds to help him with the expenses of having to go back and forth to treatments
> and normal everyday expenses, Thank you for your time and thank you for your help.
> ~ Dawn Walker
