<div class="status-box info">Due to Covid-19, we will keep following CDC protocol for outdoor recreation and gathering guidelines.</div>

The Great Kern River Cleanup is the premier volunteer event focused on removing
trash and restoring the health of the Mighty Kern throughout Sequoia National Forest.
This cleanup is an annual event coordinated by the [Sierra Nevada Conservancy](https://www.sierranevada.ca.gov/)
and this statewide effort—coordinated by the Sierra Nevada Conservancy, in conjunction
with [California Coastal Cleanup Day](https://www.coastal.ca.gov/publiced/ccd/ccd.html)
—serves to promote good stewardship on all of our waterways, from the source at 14,000ft.,
to the sea, the Pacific Ocean.

Hundreds of community groups have spread across 22 counties and over 2,200 river
miles to pull appliances, cigarette butts, beverage cans, baby diapers, tires,
furniture, and more from the rivers and streams that supply the State of California
with more than 60 percent of its water.

It's about bringing together families, neighbors, visitors and friends in a gorgeous
setting to accomplish something significant and worthwhile on behalf of our environment.
By volunteering, you will contribute to extricating the next 100 tons of trash from
our precious waterways that provide clean water to visitors and Californians alike.

The Cleanup kicks off Sierra Nevada Watershed Protection Week, established in 2015
to highlight the importance of the Sierra Nevada Region to the entire state. More
than 60% of California’s developed water supply originates in the Sierra Nevada
and millions of visitors travel to the Sierra to hike, camp, and sightsee. Whether
you think of Tahoe, Yosemite, Mammoth, or the Giant Sequoias — the [Sierra connects
us all](https://youtu.be/8He1jBGVA9w).
