Christmas in Kernville has been an annual tradition for over 25 years.  The Celebration
works in conjunction with the Christmas in Kernville Toy Drive.  This toy drive
allows us to provide a memorable Christmas for our local children.

Circle Park transforms into Santa's Village. Starting Nov. 30 -Dec. 31.  Santa
arrives in the park weekly starting

Nov.30 - Dec. 21. Times are as follows: Wednesday's from 5PM-7PM, and Saturday's
3PM-5pm. Parents, bring your cameras!

Also on November 30 is the Lake Isabella Christmas Parade! Enjoy the parade and
then come up to Kernville after the parade. At 2PM we start our Shop Hop. So look
for some incredible Small Business Saturday Deals around the town.  Our local
farmers market and vendors will be in downtown from 9am-1pm.  More info on the
Lake Isabella Parade can be found <a href="https://www.kernrivervalley.com/christmas-parade" class="underline link-color" rel="noopener external"> {% include icon.html icon='web-browser' %}here</a>

Nov. 30 will also be the Parade of Giving Toy Drive where Santa heads out with
the local car club at 3PM to collect toys for the Christmas in Kernville Toy Drive.
Locals get your toys ready.  Santa will head up Burlando Rd. and Sirretta St.
and then arrive in Circle Park. This will be the first night that Santa will be
in Circle Park for the children to give him their Christmas wishes. Santa will
be in the park until 6:30PM, before heading back to the North Pole until his next
scheduled time to visit Circle Park.

The night of Friday December 6, at 6:00pm is the Christmas Candlelight Stroll
lead by the Kern Valley Chorus-The local Sweet Adeline Chapter.  Refreshments
will be provided.  Event is weather permitting.

On Saturday, December 21nd at 11AM-2pm Santa will be handing out gifts to the
local children at the Kernville Chamber Community Hall. **Children must be on the
list provided by Kernville Elementary School**.
