The Geminid Meteor Shower peaks between Wed. the 13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup>
of December. But the forecast is for a cloudy Wed. night, so we'll be doing this
on Tues., Dec 12<sup>th</sup>, which is also the night of the new moon. This
makes Tuesday the ideal night!

All are welcome to this open hangout and star gazing party. Come for either the
meteor shower or for a place to hang out and meet people.

BYOB.
