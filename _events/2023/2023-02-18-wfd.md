## 66<sup>th</sup> Annual Whiskey Flat Days
### Gunsmoke and Petticoats

One of the most popular Festivals in all of Southern California.  Just a short
3 hour drive from Los Angeles, you will find the quaint town of Kernville, home
to Whiskey Flat Days (50 miles east of Bakersfield on Hwy 178).  Whiskey Flat Days
is held every Presidents Day Weekend.  It is a leap back to the good ol' Wild West
Days when the area was settled by gold miners, cattle ranchers and trappers.

Join us when Kernville reverts to its old name "Whiskey Flat" for four nostalgic
days of fun for the entire family. Parade, Wild West Daze Rodeo, Wild West Encampment,
Carnival Rides, Frog Jumping Contests, Whiskey Flat Mayor Contest, Food & Craft Booths,
Epitaph, Costume & Whiskerino Contests, Line Dancing, Pet Parade, Blue Grass & Country
Western Music, Art Show, Gunfighter Skits, Kids Activities, Games, & much more!
