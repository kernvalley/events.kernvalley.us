The KRV Bridge Connection is here to help connect you to valuable support nonprofit agencies from across Kern County.

Join us on November 14th as we POP-UP at the Kern River Valley Senior Center to help you prepare for winter. CAPK will be here to assist with past due utility bills, and to provide valuable information and resources to weatherize your home as you prepare for the chilly days ahead.

Come and learn how to face the challenges of winter with the KRV Bridge Connection-bridging you to services.
