For 30 years from 1988 to 2018, the Keyesville Classic has drawn casual riders,
pro mountain bike racers and their friends and families to participate in a fun-filled
weekend of bike-related events and activities. From the entertaining Vintage class
and trials events to the highly challenging All-Mountain Stage Race where riders
tackle the Cross-Country, Short Track and Super D courses all on the same bike,
the Keyesville Classic has something for everyone, riders and spectators alike.
This year we will be adding the ever growing drop bar class and the controversial
Class 1 e-bike class.
