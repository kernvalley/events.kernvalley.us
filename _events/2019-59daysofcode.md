The big day is finally here! Over 25 teams are ready to show off what they've built
in 59 days.

You'll see each team present their products at their booths during The Arena and
hear the finalists pitch from the stage to a crowd and our panel of judges.

At the end of the day, we'll see who walks away with the **two, $10,000** grand prizes!
We'll also hand out second place cash prizes, third place cash prizes, and a **$1,000
People's Choice Award.**

This is a huge day for the community of Kern County to support these entrepreneurs
and celebrate the beginning of a new chapter for technology in Kern County!

- **The Arena**: 12pm 
- **Finalist Pitches**: 2:45pm
- **Awards Presentation**: 4:30pm
