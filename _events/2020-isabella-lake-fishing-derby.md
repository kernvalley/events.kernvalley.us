The 31<sup>st</sup> Annual Isabella Lake Fishing Derby is shaping up to be a good time this
April 4 - 6, 2020. Our first Trout are being delivered to the fish rearing pens
at Red's Marina in November and will growing fast, They are fed three times a day
by an all volunteer crew organized by Kern River Valley Chamber of Commerce and
derby committee member Mark Chambers. Thank you everyone involved for all the hard
work, these fish eat a lot and have to be fed rain or shine, sleet or sun, and it's
getting cold out there! By the time these Trout are released right before the
tournament they will all be fat and happy and ready to bite a line.
