Wine & Food Festival

You can purchase tickets at the gate (if they are still available) for $50

**Once at the festival if you would like to sample more goodies, additional tickets
will be available for sale there.**

And it’s all for a great cause…

All net proceeds will go to supporting two Kern River Valley stellar and hard
working animal rescue organizations: FYDO and SOS.

The love of a dog is unconditional.  A friendly face to greet you every morning.
A trusted friend, always having your back by your side through it all.  The lucky
ones have a forever family to love and care for our furry friends.  But not all
dogs are so fortunate.  Some are neglected, abused, or abandoned.  The only way
to safety is our friends at S.O.S. (Strength of Shadow) and FYDO (Fix Your Dog Organization).
They do some wonderful work, because when spirits are broken, they mend the heart.
But they can’t do it without your help!

Learn more about FYDO and what they do here:  [FYDO – The Fix Your Dog Org](https://fydo.us/)

Learn more about SOS and what they do here:  [SOS Dog Rescue Website](https://www.strengthofshadow.org/about)

Come.  Drink Wine.  Eat Food.  Rescue Animals!

It’s a Win-Win-Win in our book!
