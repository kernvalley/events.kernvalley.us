Join Kern River Conservancy and the Kernville Chamber of Commerce as we partner
up to create and open a looped nature walk. The trail will run parallel with the
river and loop around through the Whiskey Flat Encampment. We will create and
enhance sections of trail, clear dead brush and post interpretive signs around
the area for residents and visitors to experience.

Please RSVP directly with us at <a href="mailto:info@kernriverconservancy.org" class="underline link-color">{% include common/icon.html icon='mail-unread' %}info@kernriverconservancy.org.</a>

We will provide snacks and refreshments for volunteers. Tools and safety
equipment will be provided to all. Please dress accordingly to weather and wear
sturdy hiking shoes.
