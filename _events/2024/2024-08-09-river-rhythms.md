Join us for a FREE concert in Riverside Park in Kernville every Friday at 6pm during the month of August. Bring your lawn chair, blanket, a picnic and your family and friends to enjoy two hours of music. 

River Rhythms originated in 2011 by Charlie Busch, Owner/Operator of Kern River Radio (102.5FM, 104.5FM and 1140AM). Busch envisioned a concert series that showcases local bands, provides an opportunity for a family-fun community event and raises funds for the local community. A special thanks to the Kern Valley Health Care District (KVHD) for serving as a sponsor.
